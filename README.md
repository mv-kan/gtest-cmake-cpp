# Simple cmake/gtest c++ 20 setup

this is simple setup for cpp project with gtest and cmake. You just need to rename `mymodule` and `myproject` strings accross whole boilerplate

## Stuff you may want to change

As I said
1. rename `mymodule` or delete it if you don't need it
2. rename `myproject` in `CMakeLists.txt`
3. point to the latest commit in google test in `CMakeLists.txt`
4. `set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)` change `Debug` to `Release` when you compile for release (duh)

## Features



## VS Code, google test C++ intellisense shows errors
